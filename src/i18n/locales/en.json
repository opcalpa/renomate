However, you should report defects as soon as you discover them (within 'reasonable time').\n\nMany contractors offer a specific warranty period (1-5 years) — this does not limit your legal rights but may make the claims process easier during that period.\n\nAlways do a thorough inspection (slutbesiktning) when the work is finished."
